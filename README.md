# Domain Based Quiz system 🎮📊

Live At: https://xyz-frontend-two.vercel.app

xyz is a **student-centric, gamified performance dashboard** designed to reduce quiz-related anxiety and improve learning clarity.  
Instead of overwhelming students with raw scores and tables, WIN7 presents performance data as a **personal Heads-Up Display (HUD)** that motivates, reassures, and guides students.

This project was built as part of **WINTERNTHON** by **Team XYZ**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Modern quiz and assessment platforms focus heavily on **raw marks, ranks, and tables**.  
While data-heavy, these systems often:

- Increase **student anxiety**
- Provide **no real-time feedback**
- Fail to show **learning progress**
- Ignore **emotional impact of failure**
- Lack strict **privacy and access control**

As a result, students *feel* like they are failing—even when they are actually improving.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

xyz replaces traditional dashboards with a **personalized, gamified student HUD** that acts like a **coach instead of a judge**.

### Key Ideas:
- Replace marks with **meaningful performance indicators**
- Reward **effort, speed, and consistency**, not just correct answers
- Reframe mistakes as **learning opportunities**
- Provide **real-time reassurance** during live sessions
- Enforce **strict data privacy**
